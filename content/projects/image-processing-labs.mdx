## Lab Focus

- Implemented spatial filters: mean/median, Gaussian blur, Laplacian, high-boost, unsharp masking, and Sobel/Prewitt edges.
- Compared responses on grayscale test images and custom matrices to understand the math behind each kernel.

## MATLAB Workflow

- Scripted reusable functions for convolution, padding, and histogram plotting.
- Visualized intermediate results and frequency-domain intuition via FFT magnitude plots.
- Built a small CLI menu to apply filters with adjustable parameters.

## Manual Practice

- Solved paper exercises by calculating filtered pixel values by hand.
- Analyzed the effect of kernel size, scaling factors, and normalization choices.

## Outcome

These labs improved my signal-processing intuition and tied directly into computer-vision coursework.

## Impact

Because each experiment includes MATLAB scripts, CLI helpers, and handwritten derivations, I can easily adapt the work into tutorials or live demos for study groups. That combination of reproducible code and theory is now a differentiator when I explain how I debug noise-reduction pipelines or edge detectors in real-world projects.

The assets also seeded a dark-theme gallery for halukertekin.com where I plan to embed before/after comparisons and Turkish explanations so classmates can learn from the same labs that leveled up my CV chops.

## Ozet (TR)

MATLAB'de farkli uzamsal filtreleri uygulayip hem gorsel sonuclari hem de el ile hesaplamalari yaparak goruntu islemenin temelini pekistirdim.
