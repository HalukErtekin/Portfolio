## Notebook Stack

- Python 3.11, Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.
- Datasets inspired by credit risk, student performance, and telecom churn problems.

## Experiments

1. **Decision Trees:** Calculated entropy, information gain, and Gini by hand before using DecisionTreeClassifier. Tuned depth, min samples, and pruning to study over/underfitting.
2. **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding, scaling, missing-data imputation, and correlation analysis.
3. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision/recall, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, cross-validation, and learning curves.
4. **Explainability:** Feature-importance charts and SHAP-style reasoning for stakeholders.

## Automation

- Parameter sweeps with GridSearchCV and reproducible random seeds.
- Notebook hygiene via papermill tags and exported HTML/PDF summaries.

## Learnings

Balancing interpretability with model accuracy helped me reason about ML deployments within constrained academic projects.

## Impact

Packaging the notebooks with clear evaluation write-ups means I can hand them to a teammate—or a recruiter—and they immediately understand the problem framing, metrics, and trade-offs. These summaries now power the `/projects` grid while doubling as a living portfolio of data storytelling techniques I bring to internships.

Automating exports and linting keeps the experiments reproducible. When I iterate on new datasets, I can fork the same structure, swap the CSV, and quickly produce publishable insights for halukertekin.com without reinventing the wheel.

## Ozet (TR)

Karar agaclari ve klasik ML yontemlerini pandas + scikit-learn ile uygulayarak metrikleri dogru yorumlamayi ve asiri/eksik ogrenmeyi kontrol etmeyi ogrendim.
