## Overview

This full-stack platform, built for Kultur Technologies, keeps browser-based messaging fully in-house to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, and real-time workflow requirements. A Go API layer applies AES-256 encryption, PostgreSQL stores all messages plus key metadata, and an HTML/CSS/JS interface delivers a responsive chat experience across desktop and mobile.

## Motivation

- Cyber threats and data-leak risks targeting enterprise chat channels continue rising.
- Commercial SaaS tools are costly, closed-source, and often inflexible.
- The goal was to build a company-controlled messaging stack with end-to-end encryption and a customizable web UX.

## Project Objectives

- Design secure messaging with AES-256.
- Support real-time text and multimedia sharing.
- Implement strong authentication and access control.
- Model a structured PostgreSQL schema with isolated key storage.
- Provide a responsive front end that optimizes usability.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (HTML5/CSS3/JS)

- Login/registration flows, chat panel, media upload/preview.
- Responsive layouts for mobile and desktop with instant message rendering.

### Backend (Go)

- Manages sessions and token validation.
- Routes messages, queues delivery, and leverages Go's concurrency.
- Uses `crypto/aes` + `crypto/cipher` for AES-256 CBC encryption.
- Handles multimedia encoding, API endpoints, and error management.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

- Stores user profiles with hashed credentials.
- Persists encrypted messages, timestamps, sender/receiver IDs.
- Keeps 256-bit keys plus IV metadata inside a dedicated MessageKeys table.
- ER model centers on Users, Messages, and MessageKeys to maintain referential integrity.

## Cryptographic Workflow

1. Generate a secure 256-bit key and random IV.
2. Encrypt message payload with AES-256 CBC and Base64 encode it.
3. Write ciphertext to PostgreSQL while storing keys in a separate table.
4. Decrypt only for authorized users; historical ciphers like Playfair or Vigenere were evaluated but rejected for insufficient strength.

## Core Functionality

- **Authentication:** Validates hashed credentials, maintains sessions, and enforces input checks.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Enables direct text/multimedia exchange between authenticated users.
- **Multimedia Sharing:** Encrypts and stores images server-side, decoding them for recipients.
- **Key Management:** Separates message keys to add another defense layer against unauthorized access.
- **Database Integrity:** Links every message to both users and key records for full traceability.

## Implementation Notes

- Go backend exposes endpoints for message send/receive, authentication, and file uploads.
- Frontend pages (`Auth.html`, `Chat.html`) handle async updates to keep the chat live.
- Activity flow: user logs in â†’ backend issues JWT/session â†’ messages are encrypted and stored â†’ authorized clients decrypt on demand.

## Testing & Evaluation

- **Authentication:** Verified valid/invalid login cases and brute-force protections.
- **Messaging Stability:** Maintained low latency under concurrent message exchanges.
- **AES Validation:** Confirmed proper error handling for malformed keys/IVs and correctness of encryption/decryption.
- **Multimedia:** Ensured Base64-encoded images remain intact end to end.
- **Cipher Benchmark:** Demonstrated AES-256 superiority over classical methods for both security and media compatibility.

## Security Strengths

- AES-256 plus isolated key storage keeps database records unreadable.
- Password hashing, form validation, and the modular Go backend minimize attack surface.
- PostgreSQL constraints guarantee consistency and auditability.

## Applications

- Internal corporate chat and secure document/image transfer.
- Industries requiring strict confidentiality (finance, legal, consulting).
- Remote teams needing custom, organization-owned collaboration tools.

## Conclusion

By combining AES-256 encryption, Go services, PostgreSQL data modeling, and a modern web UI, the system delivers a messaging environment centered on confidentiality, integrity, and operational efficiency. It also lays groundwork for future upgrades such as group chats, automatic key rotation, message expiration, and broader end-to-end encryption features.

## Summary

I engineered an AES-256 encrypted, Go-backed, PostgreSQL-persisted browser messaging platform for Kultur Technologies that unifies real-time chat, multimedia sharing, authentication, and key management in one secure architecture.
