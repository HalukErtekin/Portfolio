## Foundations

- Set up GCC and VS Code devcontainers on Linux.
- Practiced compiling with custom Makefiles and sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,undefined).

## Key Exercises

- **Memory:** Custom string utilities, manual malloc/ree management, deep copies, and leak-free linked lists.
- **Algorithms:** Luhn credit card validator, GPA calculator, Caesar/Vigenere ciphers, and word-frequency counters.
- **File I/O:** CSV parsers, binary file inspectors, bitmap header readers, and log filters.

## Quality & Tooling

- Heavy use of algrind and clang-tidy to catch undefined behavior.
- Documented lessons around pointer arithmetic, segmentation faults, and stack vs heap usage.
- Wrote small unit tests with the criterion framework for reusable helpers.

## Takeaways

This journey sharpened my understanding of how memory actually works, which influences how I write higher-level languages today.

## Ozet (TR)

GCC ve VS Code ortaminda pointer'lar, dinamik bellek, dosya I/O'su ve algoritma alistirmalari yaparak C dilini dusuk seviyede kavradim.
