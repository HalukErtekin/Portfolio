## Foundations

- Set up GCC and VS Code devcontainers on Linux.
- Practiced compiling with custom Makefiles and sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,undefined).

## Key Exercises

- **Memory:** Custom string utilities, manual malloc/free management, deep copies, and leak-free linked lists.
- **Algorithms:** Luhn credit card validator, GPA calculator, Caesar/Vigenere ciphers, and word-frequency counters.
- **File I/O:** CSV parsers, binary file inspectors, bitmap header readers, and log filters.

## Quality & Tooling

- Heavy use of Valgrind and clang-tidy to catch undefined behavior.
- Documented lessons around pointer arithmetic, segmentation faults, and stack vs heap usage.
- Wrote small unit tests with the criterion framework for reusable helpers.

## Takeaways

This journey sharpened my understanding of how memory actually works, which influences how I write higher-level languages today.

## Impact

Documenting each lab in markdown plus inline comments gave me a repeatable recipe for onboarding classmates or debugging under pressure. I now have a grab-and-go boilerplate for argument parsing, logging, and test harnesses that speeds up new CLI utilities whenever inspiration strikes.

It also sparked a bilingual knowledge base—English for global collaborators and Turkish for local classmates—so I can share tips on segmentation faults, stack frames, and compiler warnings without losing nuance. Those teaching notes directly inform the blog content planned for halukertekin.com.

## Ozet (TR)

GCC ve VS Code ortaminda pointer'lar, dinamik bellek, dosya I/O'su ve algoritma alistirmalari yaparak C dilini dusuk seviyede kavradim.
