## Scope

I used the classic HR schema to sharpen Oracle SQL and PL/SQL skills that I rely on during coursework and internships.

- Advanced joins, subqueries, and set operators.
- Analytic/window functions such as RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, and LAG/LEAD.
- Aggregations with rollup, cube, and grouping sets.

## PL/SQL Workbench

- Stored procedures to automate HR reports and bulk updates.
- Functions with exception handling and deterministic hints.
- Explicit cursors plus cursor FOR loops for payroll simulations.
- Row-level and statement-level triggers for audit/history tables.
- Packaged logic (spec + body) for reusable HR utilities.

## Modelling & Tooling

- Oracle SQL Developer and SQLcl for execution plans and profiling.
- Oracle Data Modeler to reverse engineer the schema and produce ERDs.
- Focus on writing explainable code with DBMS_OUTPUT logging.

## Learnings

This practice solidified my understanding of execution plans, statistics, and PL/SQL best practices such as BULK COLLECT, LIMIT clauses, and layered exception blocks.

## Ozet (TR)
