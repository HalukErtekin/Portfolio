## Overview

I migrated my portfolio to AWS EC2 and treated it like a real production workload: custom domain hosting, SSL termination, systemd process management, and zero-downtime deploys. Everything runs on Amazon Linux 2023 with Node.js + pnpm.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Networking:** Security Groups restricted to SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443); fail2ban + UFW for extra protection.
- **Domain & DNS:** Hostinger DNS records point to the EC2 elastic IP; Cloudflare tested for latency/caching.
- **Nginx & SSL:** Reverse proxy + static file serving, Let's Encrypt certificates with certbot renewals, HTTP -> HTTPS redirect.
- **System Services:** Node.js app wrapped in a `portfolio.service` unit; `pnpm build` + `pnpm start` controlled by systemd.

## Deployment Workflow

1. Push code to GitHub (`HalukErtekin/Portfolio`).
2. SSH into EC2 and `git pull`.
3. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build`.
4. `sudo systemctl restart portfolio` to swap binaries safely.
5. Nginx keeps serving traffic while the Node process restarts.

## Operations & Learnings

- Tuned kernel limits and swap to keep the t3.micro instance responsive.
- Added CloudWatch/cron checks for disk, certificate expiry, and zombie processes.
- Documented the full runbook for anyone else touching the server.
